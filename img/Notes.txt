- astronaut was cropped from a very high res version I found on TinEye (it could be upscaled, but I'm not sure). Due to the widespread nature of the image, I don't know the exact version Microsoft used, but this will do. I also had to rotate it a bit. 
- The version of chess present here uses a teal background as that is what the original used. I was going to include an edited version with the background changed to red, but it didn't turn out neatly enough.
- guitar lacks the drop shadow and grey background present in XP.
- Some of the others present here may have less/more saturation than they do in XP.
- The following are not present due to them being taken down from Getty Images or vanishing altogether: butterfly, dirt bike, frog (sorry frog stans), horse, palm tree, pink flower and skater, although I have included an alternate shot of the last one (see Below Shot of Boy on Skateboard in Other Stock Photos), albeit it has a navy blue background instead of green.
